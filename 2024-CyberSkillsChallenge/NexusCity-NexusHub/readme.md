## Description

Welcome to SmartCity Nexus Hub! We're thrilled to have you join our vibrant community where discussions on smart cities, IoT, and cutting-edge urban technologies come to life. Feel free to explore the various channels, engage in discussions, and share your insights.

Please note, this server has been thoroughly cleared of any hidden data or secrets. Everything here is just as it seems... or is it? ðŸ‘€

## Solution

Joining the server reveals a few text channels and 2 voice channels. The only channel with any posts was the 'welcome-and-rules' channel where a profile called 'Admin' posted a comment stating that the server had been purged.

Hovering over the profile image of 'Admin' revealed a portion of the flag

  ```

All of the other clues relating to the identity of the profile 'Admin" turned out to be a deep rabbit hole.

The next step was to view the members of the server and this step probably didn't work out as the challenge creator intended. There was another member of the server with a clue you were supposed to identify, but as the competition progressed and competitors joined the server, it created a lot of noise in the form of security paranoid fake sock puppet accounts, making it harder to find the intended clue. Somewhere in the list was a profile named 'John Doe' and hovering on this account revealed something strange in the profile image that looked like part of the flag.

However the text was way too small to read clearly and so a trick was needed in order to capture this text in a readable format. First you needed to enable developer mode in your discord profile which grants you the ability to click on a user profile and copy the users Discord ID. Once you have this, you can use a website called [discord.id](https://discord.id/) to paste the users ID and give you ability to view/download a full sized image of the users profile picture. This made the text large enough to be able to make out the characters

The final piece came from a voice channel. CLicking in to any voice channel and opening the soundboard revealed a custom sound for this server. It was called 'nibetsap' which is just 'pastebin' in reverse.

You can click on the sound icon to play the sound which basically revealed some spoke words but sped up so fast it sounded like a chipmonk.

You can right click on the sound and download it as an .ogg file

Play it in something like VLC and slow the sound down to 0.30 speed in order to be able to hear what is being said.

The sound spells out the string '9fvbDVUg' and if you follow the name of the sound and head to pastebin [https://pastebin.com/9fvbDVUg](https://pastebin.com/9fvbDVUg)
